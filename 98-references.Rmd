If you'd like to change the name of the bibliography to something else,
delete "References" and replace it.

# References {-}

<!--
This manually sets the header for this unnumbered chapter.
-->

\markboth{References}{References}

<!--
To remove the indentation of the first bib entry, include "\noindent"
-->

<!--
To create spacing between entries. This line may need to be removed for styles
that don't require the space, or if spacing is specified in the reference style .cls.
-->

\setlength{\parskip}{8pt}

<!--
This is just for testing with more citations for the bibliography at the end. 
Add other entries into the list here if you'd like them to appear in the
bibliography even if they weren't explicitly cited in the document.
-->

<!--
This forces the location of references, and is necessary because Rmarkdown
typically places the bibliography at the end of the document
